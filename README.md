# Contaminant_indicators

Creating indicator data (levels/trends) for contaminants in biota on the Norwegian coast, based on both NIFES and NIVA data  
  
* Created data (csv) are saved in the 'Data_export' folder and manually re-saved as Excel    
* Note that resuts use   
    - limits from `Input_data/Grenseverdier_fra_Sylvia.xlsx` 
    - trend functions from `00_Trend_functions.R`  
  
### Last scripts are the one marked '2021'     
* Data up until 2019 included   
* For cod, we use     
    - NIFES data (prepared using scripts 11 and 12)   
    - NIVA data (prepared using script 13)   
    - NIFES + NIVA cod data are combined in script 14    
* For blue mussel and snails (only NIVA data) we use script 05
